Dear Replicant Team! 

This WAS FUN ! I thank you for that. 
Please review allure screenshots as well . 
to execute pytest and generate files required for allure report use 

"pytest -v --alluredir=/home/iidwuurliik/Desktop/py_dev/replicant/report" <---change home folder 

to execute only positive tests use 
pytest -v -m regression -m "positive"
